# Part 2 - Inverse guessing game (50 pts) 

# Letâ€™s inverse the roles in the guessing game.
#  This time, the player chooses a secret number
#  between 1 and 10 (in their mind) that the computer
#  must guess. For this purpose, the computer suggests
#  a number and the player indicates if it is 1) too big, 2) too small or 3) correct.
#  The player's response should be read as user input. If the number is correct, 
#  the program should terminate. Otherwise the computer will ask another number repeatedly. The
 # computer only has three attempts to guess the right number.

# Write the inverse guessing game as a new Python program in the file part2.py.
#  Before starting to program, make sure to plan out your algorithm (maybe on paper).

# Hint: The strategy the compute should follow is similar to Binary Search.
#  It's okay if the computer always guesses 5 as the first number although
#  that will make some numbers "unreachable". You may also select a random number as
#  the first number, but you should still use the steps of Binary Search to guess the next numbers.
